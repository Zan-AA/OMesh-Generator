# OMesh Generator
## Desciption
This script details the generation of 2D Euler-type structured O-meshes using Karmanâ€“Trefftz conformal transformation. Details of the generation procedure as well as the theoretical background can be found in the paper by Vassberg & Jameson:

  volume={47},
  number={4},

```

## Installation
This script requires the minimum python3 and matplotlib functionalities. For saving the mesh, the script provides one option of using plot3d (https://github.com/nasa/plot3d_utilities) which can be installed via
```
pip3 install plot3d
```
The user can also modify the script to generate other meshes (such as using meshio).

## Result
Here, we show two figures that resemble with the figures (Fig.1 and Fig. 2) shown in the paper.
